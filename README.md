# Nudge API examples

## Why ?

- do you need to retrieve data from Nudge APM ?
- do you need to automate operations like "creating new app" or "managing user access" ?

If you answered *yes* to any of above questions, then you are on the right place.

## 5 minute tutorial

1. Create API token

2. Test connection

3. Explore API

## Other languages

This repository contains examples using *bash* scripting language because it's almost always available on unix/linux
and you can even install it on Windows using *Cygwin* or *Git Bash*.

The goal here is to show you how to authenticate and use API for your needs. Once you get this, you'll be able to
do it in any language platform.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us at helpdesk@nudge.org.
